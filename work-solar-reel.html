                <div class="subtitle"><p>OBJECTIVE</p></div>
                <p>To design a solar-powered vehicle prototype with light-sensing capabilities within a $75 budget. Design parameters such as vehicle capacity, light responsiveness, and maintenance component removability. All expenses, including those for tools and fasteners, must be tracked.</p>
                
                <div class="subtitle"><p>PROCESS</p></div>
                <p>MATLAB was used to analyze and establish realistic solar cell capacities and necessary gear ratios before prototyping. The selection between an unconventional reel design and a traditional vehicle design was made through the Pairwise Comparison Matrix and the Pugh Decision Matrix. Subsequently, an Arduino program was coded for light sensing. The construction of the prototype involved laser cutting for precision, and the prototype underwent four final verification tests to comply with design and safety parameters.</p>

                <div class="subtitle"><p>RESULTS</p></div>
                <p>Despite exceeding the target budget by $5, the final design won first place in the FSE 100 vehicle speed competition while concurrently satisfying specifications on solar power, towing capacity, and payload safety.</p>
